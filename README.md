Digital Humanities: research notes, ideas, plans.

# TODO

Pseudo research proposal in which I state what I know about public
history and the digital humanities and some of the questions I would
like to ask about how these two fields might intersect. This could
form the basis of a real ?PhD proposal.

# Names

'Digital humanities' or 'humanities computing'? Questions about
nomenclature.

Some thoughts:

* [arts-humanities.net](http://www.arts-humanities.net/deliberative_humanism_social_software_digital_humanities)
  
* [humanities computing or humanistic informatics?](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/hcs/terminology.html) (from 1999)

# Research needs

'we still lack seminal studies that demonstrate real research
breakthroughs that wouldn't have been possible without computer
assisted analysis' --
[Ian Anderson (UK)](http://www.arts-humanities.net/forumtopic/ian_anderson_association_history_computing)

# Challenges

[Problems of acknowledgement and citation](http://www.arts-humanities.net/forumtopic/shut_all_our_websites_down)
