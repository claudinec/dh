Digital Humanities: research notes, ideas, plans.

TODO
====

Pseudo research proposal in which I state what I know about public
history and the digital humanities and some of the questions I would
like to ask about how these two fields might intersect. This can help me
prepare my presentation for LCA2010 and possibly form the basis of a
real ?PhD proposal.
