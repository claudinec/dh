Wikis: Wikipedia, Mediawiki and others

Wikipedia is the largest (?) and best-known wiki, but it is by no means the only example of how a wiki can function. Neither is it the only medium for public, collaborative, dynamic content editing â€” see discussion of CMSes.

Many different wiki engines available.
